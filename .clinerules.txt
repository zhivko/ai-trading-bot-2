# Python Environment
Always activate the virtual environment before running Python scripts: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
Assume that we are running Flask server with reload=True so all changed python files are automatically reloaded in running flask app.

# Code Style
Use 4 spaces for indentation in Python files
Prefer f-strings over .format() for string formatting
